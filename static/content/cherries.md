## Cherry Blossom
<var data-map id="intro-map" data-center="51.4,0.53" data-zoom="2"></var>

### Introduction

Cherry blossoms have formed an integral part of the identity of Washington, D. C., ever since Japan gifted over three thousand cherry trees to the United States in 1912 as a symbol of friendship and political alliance. Until the final decades of the 19th century, Japanese cherry trees had often been misunderstood among Westerners, and garnered only modest attention in Europe. Subsequent European involvement in East Asia forced Japan, which had pursued a strict isolationist policy for centuries, to open its borders. As a result, Europeans enjoyed greater contact with Japanese culture, and a growing interest in cherry blossoms. With the planting of Japan’s gift of cherry trees in the <var  id="Q956781">Tidal Basin</var>, cherry blossoms became accessible to the American public, entering Western consciousness on an unprecedented scale.

Although cherry blossoms became beloved fixtures of the city of Washington, attitudes toward cherry trees have at times varied: Washington’s cherry trees have been both objects of preservation and destruction, reverence and aggression. By the 1930s, cherry blossoms were so ingrained in the public’s imagination of Washington, D.C., that the removal of cherry trees on the Tidal Basin to make room for the Jefferson Memorial caused a public outcry. Only a few years later, during World War II, cherry blossoms’ association with Japan meant that they occupied an ambiguous place in the city, at once threateningly foreign and close to home. As gifts from Japan symbolizing the relationship between the two countries, the cherry trees on the Tidal Basin embody and give witness to the exchange between two cultures at the heart of Washington, D.C.

### Cherry Trees in Japan
<var data-map  id="japan-map" data-center="35.9,137.4" data-zoom="6"></var>
<var title="Tokyo" id="Q1490"></var>

The cherry blossom has been a repository of symbolism in Japanese culture for centuries: it has variously symbolized processes of life, death, reproductive power, love, rebirth, and the beauty of impermanence. By the end of the Edo period (1603-1868) cherry blossoms came to be a dominant symbol of Japanese identity, although their association with Japanese identity dates to at least the ninth century. During the early years of Japan’s rapid industrialization, cherry trees fell prey to an iconoclastic drive to erase reminders of the old feudal society. As Japan continued to negotiate its national identity, cherries were taken up again, now as symbols of a modern Japan that would be recognizable on an international scale. In the years leading up to World War II, the image of falling cherry blossoms, which had traditionally been associated with impermanence and death, was increasingly deployed to aestheticize self-sacrifice for the emperor. Cherry blossoms were planted in shrines glorifying fallen soldiers, and featured prominently in military imagery.

#### Cherry viewing in Japan
<var data-video id="jk0ic0D0MRo" title="Hanami"></var>
<var data-image id="cherry-blossoms-mint-tunnel" title="Cherry Blossom Viewing through the Tunnel at Japan Mint" data-url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Cherry-Blossom-Viewing_through_the_%22Tunnel%22_at_Japan_Mint_in_201504_004.JPG" data-region="1356,1039,2182,2290"></var>

Flower-viewing or hanami is a centuries-old practice in Japan. Flower viewing started in imperial circles in the eighth century, when the Japanese elite eagerly adopted Chinese high culture. Chinese plum blossoms were initially the object of viewing parties. By the ninth century, hanami was practically synonymous with viewing cherry blossoms, as Japanese elites sought to delineate a distinctly Japanese identity. In the 18th century, mass plantings were made in poor riverside districts of present-day Tokyo, many of which were notorious for prostitution, gambling, and licentious theater. Plantings of cherry trees were meant to beautify riverside communities, which the government considered eyesores. These mass plantings helped make cherry-viewing a popular pastime across all classes. Both new cherry-picnic sites and sites historically famous for imperial outings became widely popular spots for drink, merry-making and the loosening of social conventions.

### Cherries in the West

Before the craze for Japanese cherries in the West at the start of the twentieth century, Europeans knew little of Japanese cherry blossoms, and Westerners who visited Japan often complained of how flowering Japanese cherry trees bore no fruit. As shipping techniques improved in the early 19th century, Japanese cherries began to trickle into European gardens in 1832, but remained unfashionable until the 1870s. When Japan opened its borders, greater contact with Japanese culture fueled interest in cherry blossoms among Westerners. By the 1890’s, Japan was marketing and exporting cherry trees to the West. However, cherries did not reach wide audiences in the West until Japan gave thousands of cherry trees to the United States in the early 20th century.

#### Cherries in D.C.

In 1912, Japan gifted thousands of cherry trees to the United States as a gesture of friendship. A previous shipment, made in 1909, was burned upon entry into the United States when it was discovered that the trees were infected. The trees from 1912 prospered, becoming a beloved part of the city and an enduring symbol of the United States’ relationship with Japan. Most of the trees in the Tidal Basin were of the Yoshido variety, or Prunus x yedoensis. There are ongoing efforts to preserve the few surviving cherries from 1912 as witnesses to Washington’s history.

##### Cherry Rebellion 1938

On November 17, 1938, the day construction began on the Jefferson Memorial, dozens of Washingtonian women marched to the White House armed with a petition to prevent damage to cherries during the construction. Many considered the preservation of the Japanese cherry trees to be more in keeping with American values than building a large and expensive marble monument on the Tidal basin. Eleanor "Cissy" Patterson, the owner and editor of the Washington Times-Herald, wrote articles vociferously criticizing the FDR administration, and led protests on the Tidal Basin. The protestors chained themselves to a tree, seized shovels from workers, refilled holes, and prepared themselves to obstruct bulldozers. Although officials assured the public the cherry trees would be transplanted, the protesters did not stand down until they spoke with Assistant Secretary of the Interior Michael Strauss, who brought lunch and copious amounts of coffee. In dire need of restrooms, the women finally unchained themselves from the cherry tree. President Roosevelt had the remaining trees removed at night to prevent conflict, and the construction of the Jefferson Memorial proceeded smoothly.

##### Vandalism 1942

A few days after Pearl Harbor, vandals cut down four cherry trees in the night, leaving “to hell with those Japanese” carved into the stumps of one of the felled trees. Letters flooded the White House calling for the removal of all Japanese cherry trees. Many people wrote letters to newspapers in defense of cherry blossoms, calling the vandals out for chauvinism. Japanese cherries were renamed Oriental cherries to prevent the destruction of any more trees. The annual cherry festival, held since 1935, was suspended for the remainder of the war, partly because of the austere wartime economy and partly because of cherry blossoms’ association with Japan. Despite the suspension of the cherry festival, the public continued to enjoy the cherry blossoms on the Tidal Basin during the War, as attested by the photographs taken by Esther Bubley in 1943 for the Farm Security Administration.

#### Cherries at Dumbarton Oaks

Located in the Northeastern corner of Dumbarton Oaks, Cherry Hill is planted with the Japanese cherry varieties Prunus sargentii, Prunus subhirtella, and Prunus x yedoensis, the most abundant cherry in the Tidal Basin. Fruit-bearing black cherries, Prunus serotina, can also be found in the gardens. By isolating a large grouping of cherries on Cherry Hill, landscape architect Beatrix Farrand created a space devoted to the display of cherry blossoms that would not be a conspicuous part of the gardens when not in bloom.

### Tale of Genji

The Tale of Genji, written in the early years of the 11th century by the noblewoman Murasaki Shikibu, depicts an imperial court brimming with elegance and intrigue, where cherry-viewing parties set the stage for love and courtship. Although The Tale of Genji marked a turning-point in the development of the aesthetics of pathos and the keen awareness of ephemerality (monono aware), cherry blossoms are largely symbols of youth and love in the novel. This screen depicts a scene from chapter thirty four, New Herbs I, in which the courtier Kashiwagi falls in love while playing kickball under blossoming cherry trees as he catches sight of Genji’s new wife behind a bamboo blind that a cat has pushed open.

“The women had been too delighted with the game, young gentlemen heedless of how they scattered the blossoms, to worry about blinds and concealment.”

Flore des serres et des jardins de l'Europe : Annales générales d'horticulture

Published: Gand (Belgique) : L. van Houtte, 1875

Cherry blossoms imported from Japan began appearing in French and Belgian magazines in the 1870s. Flore des Serres, published by Belgian horticulturist Louis van Houtte, shows a cultivar named “Cerasus caproniana flore roseo pleno” for sale in his nursery. This is probably the cultivar Fukurokuju, a semi-double, pink-flowered cherry that became popular in the West. Fukurokuju cherries were planted South of the Tidal Basin in 1912.

Twelve plates with fruit : from the collection of Robt. Furber, gardiner at Kensington

Robert Furber; designed by Peter Casteels ; engraved by H. Fletcher.

[London : s.n., 1732].

Furber’s lavishly illustrated catalogue Twelve Months of Fruit is one of the earliest modern nurseryman’s catalogues. However, prices were omitted from the catalogue so as not to offend the sensibilities of its aristocratic audience, which included members of the royal family. This plate shows European interest in cherries primarily focused on the fruit, with relatively little interest paid to the blossoms’ aesthetic qualities.

Silva, or, A discourse of forest-trees, and the propagation of timber in His Majesty's dominions

John Evelyn

John Evelyn’s 17th century practical treatise on silviculture was the dominant English treatise of its kind until the nineteenth century. It encouraged English landowners to plant trees and care for their forests in order to conserve timber supplies for the Royal Navy. Evelyn explains how and where to grow black cherries, noting the ornamental value of their white blossoms and the medicinal properties of their fruit when used in spirits.

Catalogue of the Yokohama Nursery Co., Ltd

Yokohama, Japan: 1905

The Japanese-owned Yokohama Company played a significant role in the exportation of cherry blossoms to Western markets, and had offices set up in San Francisco, Chicago, New York and London by 1907. The Yokohama Company’ catalogues were lavishly decorated, catering to fashionable turn of the century fascination with Japan. The present issue, from 1905, lists cherry blossoms under the name of “pseudo-cerasus, or false-cherries, a name born out of Europeans’ initial misunderstanding of Japanese cherry blossoms, which do not bear fruit.

This set of four books is bound in the orihon, or folded accordion, style. Each book is richly illustrated with woodcuts depicting the plants that flower during each of the four seasons. The present volume is Haru, or Spring. As heralds of spring, cherry blossoms are well represented in this volume. Book illustrations of plants portraying the four seasons harken to an old Chinese tradition of painting on silk. In Japan, works of this genre were often produced or subsequently reproduced as woodblock prints.

Landscape Gardening in Japan

Josiah Conder

Tokyo : Printed by the Hakubunsha, Ginza, Tokio : Published and sold by Kelly and Walsh, Limited, Yokohama, Shanghai, Hongkong, and Singapore, 1893.

In 1877, British architect Josiah Conder was invited to teach architecture in Japan, where he introduced Western architectural and construction practices. Landscape Gardening in Japan, first published in 1893, provided Westerners a rich source on the gardening techniques and artistic principles of Japanese gardens. The present opening shows an illustration of a party on a barge viewing the wild cherry trees of Arashiyama, a famous retreat for imperial outings. Conder explains that cherry trees are, along with pines, the first trees chosen in a garden. He argues that trees with single blossoms are generally to be preferred over ones with double blossoms, which he advises be used sparingly.
