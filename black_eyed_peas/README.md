## Introduction
<!--May need to add top level 'about' eid here? have asked Ashley-->

Black-eyed peas or cowpeas, _Vigna unguiculata_ (L.) Walp., are both an ancient crop and a food of the future. Also known as caupi, southern pea, alubia carilla, neibe and frijole, as well as chowlee in India, gubgub in the West Indies and akkerboon in South Africa;[^ref1] its many names reflect its worldwide appeal. These nourishing, protein-rich, easily-grown <span eid="Q145909"> legumes </span> are closely related to mung beans, adzuki beans and bambara groundnuts. While the black-eyed pea has a global history stretching back millennia, its social and cultural significance has changed over time. From a staple crop in West and Central Africa, revered by some peoples there as a symbol of luck and fertility worthy of offering to deities, the black-eyed pea within Europe was understood as a humble food for laborers. In the Americas, too, the bean was a marker of class and culture and served as an important food source for enslaved peoples in the era of the transatlantic slave trade between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. Modern-day cuisine the world over still embraces the black-eyed pea as a food rich in culture and history as well as a delicious source of innovative dishes that celebrate new traditions. The crop is also becoming increasingly important food for the future as it is able to withstand the results of climate change. The black-eyed pea is a powerful reminder of just how intertwined human identity is with the plants we eat.

Authors since ancient times have described black-eyed peas in texts on plants and the natural world. In European botanical studies there has long existed a confusion regarding the plant’s common and Latin names, some of this stemming from ever-changing ideas of the pea’s origins and classification.[^ref17] However, it was well known by many common names throughout ancient Eurasia, and was understood as a nutritious source of food for humans and livestock alike. As the accompanying timeline illustrates, these changes in nomenclature are one important record for examination of the cultural and social role of the bean, especially in Europe. More recently, taxonomists have been re-classifying the genus _Vigna_ and today all cultivated black-eyed peas are grouped under _Vigna unguiculata_ subspecies _unguiculata_.

## Growth and Distribution <!-- An easy, useful crop -->
Black-eyed peas grow best in semi-arid conditions, nutrient-poor soils and with little help. They are heat-loving and drought-tolerant, and grow quickly, often giving a harvest within 100 days. These (mainly annual) leguminous plants (in the plant family Fabaceae) have now become a staple part of the diets of hundreds of millions of people around the world. It is not just the seeds (the beans or peas as we call them) that are harvested however – the leaves and pods of this reliable plant are also edible and used as a vegetable, or can be used for cattle fodder or hay,[^ref2] and, being legumes, they also enrich the soil, in this case through the presence of around 21 different (bradyrhizobial) symbiotic <span eid="Q15098397"> nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules </span> on their roots.[^ref3]

Archaeological and genetic evidence shows that West Africans domesticated wild relatives of the plant at least 6,000 years ago.[^ref40] Because black-eyed peas mature quickly and produce reliably with only a little land and labor, they are an important part of mixed food systems: wild gathering, hunting, fishing and aquaculture, keeping small livestock and/or building larger herds, <span eid="Q397350"> agroforestry </span>, and crop cultivation. Diverse specializations protect the community by relying on different foods at different times of the year and ensuring no single crop failure will cause a famine.[^ref41] The ease of growth and  usefulness of this crop was one of the main reasons that the black-eyed pea began to spread out of Africa.

By 1500 BCE, the black-eyed pea or cowpea had spread through North Africa and out to the Mediterranean, the Arabian Peninsula, central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. The native range of the cowpea in Africa (here shown in blue) and its subsequent introduction across the world (in green) can be seen on this map.

## Cultural Perceptions in Early Modern Europe <!-- previously titled Early Modern European History -->

Black-eyed peas have been consumed for millennia, though records of their consumption and use within Europe during the Middle Ages (roughly the fifth through to the fifteenth centuries) are relatively scarce. Understood as a food for peasants and livestock, black-eyed peas would have been considered subject matter too lowly for inclusion in the annals of history. Since antiquity, then, the black-eyed pea has been a cultural marker of those who lacked social status in European societies. Ancient Roman chronicler <span eid="Q82778"> Pliny </span> wrote that priests should avoid eating the food for fear its rough nature would upset their delicate constitutions. He also notes that <span eid="Q10261"> Pythagoras </span> and his followers did not eat black-eyed peas because they “believed the souls of the dead to be contained within" the dried beans.[^ref10] This belief may have been informed by West African traditions, which bestows black-eyed peas with the power to fend off the evil eye. Some cultural groups in West Africa, for example the Yoruba people, also prepare the beans as offerings to deities.[^ref101]

The stigma of eating dried foods, rather than fresh, further impinged the reputation of the bean and its eaters: while wealthy and socially powerful individuals could afford fresh foods, peasants relied upon cheaper dried foods. Though in their fresh green form the black-eyed pea apparently made a delicious dessert served in Sparta, on the whole the beans were shelled, dried, and used in humble soups.[^ref21] The imbrication of class, culture and food is apparent, for example, in ancient Greek and Roman 'unswept floor' mosaics, which are meant to depict the scraps strewn across a floor after a lavish banquet. In perhaps the most famous example of this genre (completed by the ancient Greek artist <span eid="Q116658"> Sosus of Pergamon </span> in the 2nd century BCE), lobster shells, olive pits, partially eaten fish, and nuts litter the ground, but nary a bean is to be found.

       url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Restes_du_banquet%2C_mosa%C3%AFque.jpg">

The oft-repeated adage 'you are what you eat,' was the rule of the day; those who ate fresh foods were understood as the wiser and healther social elite, while the consumers of dried foods were understood as less intelligent, somewhat unhealthy agents of a rough and tumble lifestyle. Such ideas persisted into the early modern period and can be seen, for example, in Italian artist <span eid="Q7824"> Annibale Carracci's </span> painting _The Bean Eater_ (painted c. 1590), which depicts a man eating a bowl of black-eyed peas. Carracci's painterly style in this work, a collection of swiftly rendered and unblended brushstrokes that give the appearance of a rough surface, acknowledges the man's status: unrefined in dress and manners, he eats a humble meal of black-eyed peas. This depiction and suggests the man and his food are unruly parts of late sixteenth-century Italy's deeply heirarchical and classist society. The beans, associated with flatulence, also suggest the food and the person eating it might be disruptive to the social fabric they inhabit. Despite the fact that black-eyed peas had been a vital part of the Southern European diet and culture for centuries, they are here presented as both marginal and familiar.

Carracci was not the only artist to depict beans or their visually similiar counterparts, peas. Throughout Europe, there are innumerable artworks that took inspiration from peas (be it their leaves, their delicate blossoms, or their sinuous tendril-filled vines). Verdant green peas considered domestic to Europe became an emblem for love, fertility, and even lust. In painter <span eid="Q7751"> Giuseppe Arcimboldo's </span> allegorical portrait of _The Summer_ (from 1573) uses a green peapod to represent a woman's smiling mouth. Each tooth corresponds to a perfectly round pea, her <span data-click-image-zoomto="2087,2269,2079,1595">spreading smile </span> a literal show of abundance.

Seventeenth-century virtuoso wood carver Grinling Gibbons produced elaborate carved wood panelling for British aristocracy, including for King William and Queen Mary at Hampton Court Palace. The artist famously nestled a carved pea pod in many of his works, this his signature motif. Dutch painters of this period also produced lush still life paintings which featured all manner of flora and fauna. In <span eid="Q454656"> Jan Davidsz de Heem's </span> painting _Vase of Flowers_, c. 1660, we see a sumptuous array of flowers with <span data-click-image-zoomto="578,5161,2382,1827"> several peapods </span> at the base of the vase. Four of the verdant green pods are closed but appear plump and full peas just ready for the eating, while another sallow pod has opened up and is being eaten by glossy black ants. The artist reveals how quickly a fresh green pea soon spoils, this a metaphor for how quickly life's pleasure fade. The painter's commentary might also be related to the pea's power to symbolize what was then understood as a form of moral ruin: peapods were synonymous with male genitalia and the term "shelling peas" became a euphemism for illicit sexual intercourse.[^ref11]

Images of black-eyed peas and other varieties of beans and peas shaped European understandings of the plant. Beginning in the sixteenth century,the dramatic rise in the production and circulation of printed texts with images, such as herbals or natural histories, reinforced the codification of plants based on their geographic origins. Unprecedented global travel also formed European ideas about the ways in which close observation of the natural world could reveal the domestic or foreign origins of a person, plant or an animal. One result of this study was a shift in European attitudes toward the black-eyed pea. Despite the millennia-old European presence of the black-eyed pea, it was now understood there as an itinerant body within a Euro-centric taxonomy of plants. European travellers visiting Africa, Asia and the Americas reinforced these ideas. Their observations, often reported in books, were soon understood throughout Europe as factual accounts. For example, Dutchman <span eid="Q3117063"> Pieter de Marees’ </span> 1602 book, describing West Africa, shows the <span data-click-image-zoomto="418,756,583,437"> black-eyed pea </span> in an idealised landscape alongside people and other plants.[^ref12] The viewer is meant to elide the black-eyed pea with Africa's geography and peoples, this distinction revealing Europe's increasingly myopic gaze upon the rest of the world.

## Food, Culture and Colonialism
              
The European perspective is not the only early modern view we have on the black-eyed pea. Written records of the pea appear in the sixteenth century in China where it is noted in the Ming Dynasty Compendium Materia Medica as (ironically) being a cure for flatulence, as well as kidney problems. Black-eyed peas were noted by Sir Thomas Herbert in 1634 as "Indian pease" by which he was referencing the peas he had seen in the West Indies.[^ref68] Meanwhile, in Japan, a copy of the extraordinary 30-volume agricultural encyclopaedia _Seikei Zuetsu_ (written 1793-1804) was gifted to the German physician, botanist and plant collector <span eid="Q77140">Philipp Franz von Siebold</span> in the 1820s. Siebold arrived in Nagasaki in 1823 and started a medical school there, but spent much of his spare time studying Japanese flora and creating his own botanical garden of Japanese plants.[^ref69] The _Seikei Zuetsu_ detailed 109 crops of southern Japan and inside its beautifully illustrated pages can be found the 'cowpea' – most probably showing _Vigna unguiculata_ subsp. _unguiculata_ cv.-gr. _sesquipedalis_ or the 'yard-long bean' which was and still is popular in Asia today.[^ref70] Its presence in this Japanese book of crops from 1800 shows how far the black-eyed pea had come and how its usefulness had been welcomed into many agricultural traditions.

The black-eyed pea's global journey is also well documented in the [Economic Botany Collection](https://www.kew.org/science/collections-and-resources/collections/economic-botany-collection) of the <span eid="Q18748726"> Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew </span>, and its presence here is telling.  Although the black-eyed pea was not grown as a crop in Britain (it usually being far too cold and wet), there are over a hundred different collections of black-eyed pea at Kew including [seeds](https://ecbot.science.kew.org/main_image.php?imageid=EBC_68901), pods, ‘fibre’ and even a [model](https://ecbot.science.kew.org/read_ecbot.php?catno=61536&search_term=vigna%20unguiculata&search_type=name&imagechecklist=Images), mainly from the 19th century, meaning that this pea was obviously studied in Britain as a useful plant from across the colonial world. Donations came from Nigeria, India, Laos, China and Japan, but also from imperial exhibitions where plant products were displayed, such as the <span eid="Q5148408"> Colonial and India Exhibition of 1886 </span>, the Japan/British Exhibition of 1910, the British Industries Fair of 1930, as well as the <span eid="Q10534945"> India Museum </span>, the Imperial Institute, and the Jamaica Agricultural Society, as well as colonial expeditions including <span eid="Q183567"> Dr WB Baikie's </span> Niger Expedition of 1859. One undated individual collection was even donated by the HRH the Prince of Wales, from the ‘East Indies’. While details on each museum object are sparse, each in itself is a micro-history of imperial interests.

Though their origins aren't always recognized, many thousands of organisms have spread across the globe with human help. Historian Alfred Crosby, writing in the 1970s, called this process the <span eid="Q767253"> ‘Columbian Exchange’</span> or the "Biological Expansion of Europe." But it was not a solely European expansion. Recent scholars like Judith Carney have expanded on the Columbian Exchange by focusing on the importance of Africans' foods and agricultural techniques. Black-eyed peas, millet, yams, and many other staple foods of the American tropics have African origins. European traders on the coast of West Africa filled hundreds of thousands of vessels with 10-12 million captives over the centuries of the <span eid="Q10701282">transatlantic slave trade</span>.[^ref43] These vessels carried humans-as-commodities as well as the foodstuffs needed for an average voyage of sixty to eighty days.[^ref45] Dry legumes, like black-eyed peas, hyacinth beans and bambara groundnuts, were staple foods cooked into gruel during the Middle Passage. Leftover stocks then accompanied captives as they dispersed throughout the Americas and the Caribbean.[^ref44] English physician, naturalist, and planter <span eid="Q310326"> Sir Hans Sloane </span> notes the black-eyed pea in Jamaica around 1687 and created this herbarium specimen there as part of his large Jamaican collection. The bean was also observed in the Carolinas by the end of the seventeenth century. [^ref103]

The hard labor of enslaved peoples ensured that the black-eyed pea or cowpea was grown and cultivated as a crop largely for livestock throughout the United States, most especially in the South. However, black-eyed peas were also a food served to enslaved peoples as well as a fixture in gardens of enslaved peoples, with the beans serving as a hearty supplement to the meagre meals allotted on plantations. Black-eyed peas also held special cultural significance to enslaved Africans; for many of them, the bean was a marker of auspicious occasions, luck and fertility. It was also a food offered both as charity to those in need and as a gift to deities. Numerous first-hand accounts of enslaved peoples mention black-eyed peas. In Charles Ball's memoir he recalls, "We had plenty of bread, and a supply of black-eyed peas, gathered from our garden, some of which [were] boiled in our kettle." [^ref18] Francis Fedric, also enslaved, wrote of the bean, "Slaves every Monday morning have a certain quantity of Indian corn handed out to them; this they grind with a handmill, and boil or use the meal as they like. The adult slaves have one salt herring allowed for breakfast, during the winter time ... The dinner consists generally of black-eyed peas soup, as it is called. About a quart of peas is boiled in a large pan, and a small piece of meat, just to flavour the soup, is put into the pan. The next day it would be bean soup ...the soup being served out to the men and women in bowls; but the children feed like pigs out of troughs." [^ref19] Black-eyed peas became “the third most important food crop produced on Carolina plantations between 1730 and 1776.”[^ref16] <span eid="Q11812"> Thomas Jefferson </span> and <span eid="Q23"> George Washington </span> both had black-eyed peas planted on their expansive plantations, and Washington corresponded with friends and acquaintances about growth and cultivation of the plant, which in a [letter of 1787](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/04-05-02-0442) he calls "small, and round black eyed Pease called the Gentlemans Pea". Jefferson considered the cultivation of peas a pursuit worthy of a gentleman, harkening back to European traditions which placed greater social and cultural status on green peas. He held yearly pea growing contests, with the first man to produce a fresh pea required to host a dinner for other gentlemen in the area. These meals, no doubt,  transpired under decidedly different conditions than those in which enslaved poeples ate their black-eyed peas. By the nineteenth century, black-eyed peas achieved new cultural cache and graced the tables of the white ruling class. Enslaved cooks played an important role in bringing this food into rarefied homes.

Throughout the <span eid="Q8676"> Civil War </span>, black-eyed peas remained an important food throughout the southern U.S., while in the North they were associated with the practice of slavery and therefore deemed undesirable. At times, the pea might have also seemed undesirable to residents of the South. In Adelaide Stuart Dimitry's memoirs of the war years (1861-1865), she notes that while food was often hard to come by, the black-eyed pea remained a reliable - to the point of tiresome - meal. She recalls: "Once at home came the dinner - where it came from was the daily surprise of life. Sometimes it consisted only of a large platter of newly-dug goobers or peanuts, boiled in salt water, but always sauced with a wondrous appetite - in that dour time never lacking in Richmond. Thrice-blessed was the household so lucky as to have a country friend. An angel of relief she came in with a basket of vegetables - generally mustard greens - in one hand, covered maybe with apple blossoms to take off its sordidness, and bending under the weight of a big jug of buttermilk. What luxury and feasting for the next few days ... But oh, the eternal, dried, black-eyed pea whether in porridge or soup, baked or boiled, ever the same villainous comestible that made one weary of going to the table!"[^ref20] [^ref102] In the late nineteenth century, American <span eid="Q2787508"> subsistence farmers </span> were encouraged to grow the black-eyed pea or cowpea even if their local climate meant they didn’t get an abundant crop of beans. Its usefulness as a soil improver, for erosion control, and as a nutritious fodder for livestock meant that this easy-to-grow crop was a valuable addition to the U.S farming landscape. Noted American scientist and innovative proponet of crop rotations, <span eid="Q296898">George Washington Carver</span> – who was enslaved at birth in Missouri in 1864 and freed after the Civil War – urged farmers in the American South to plant black-eyed peas to help replenish soil depleted by cotton farming. He felt this easily grown crop could also help lift formerly enslaved peoples out of systemically reinforced poverty. He wrote of the plant: "The cow pea is rightfully looked upon by many as the poor man’s bank or mortgage-lifter ... It is a matter of much regret that every colored farmer in Macon County does not plant at least three acres in peas."[^ref15]

A 'Farmers Bulletin' of 1920 gave specific official advice on [growing cowpeas](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QiOMV1jWGiQC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ViewAPI&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=true) in the U.S., and is handily illustrated throughout with photographs of the processes involved. Black-eyed peas were, and still are, mainly grown in southern hotter states and California, as the warm, dry conditions are more favourable for bean production there.

## Culinary History and Cultural Celebrations

Today, black-eyed peas are grown commercially in at least 33 countries,[^ref161] reflecting the widespread embrace of the bean among geographically disparate peoples, places, and cultures. As acclaimed food historian and chef Michael Twitty points out: “Very few people in the modern West eat one cuisine or live within one culinary construct,” but rather enjoy a multiplicity of culinary histories.[^ref162] Twitty coined the term “identity cooking” to characterize “how we construct complex identities and then express them through how we eat,” an idea that is useful to keep in mind for any discussion of food as widely used across culinary traditions as black-eyed peas.[^ref163]

Black-eyed peas are a staple of the <span eid="Q49042"> Southern American </span> diet and an iconic component of African American culinary history. The peas are key ingredients for everything from stews to salads to savory bean and rice dishes, but perhaps they are most iconic for their modern associations with New Year’s celebrations. <span eid="Q1763911"> Hoppin’ John </span> is a popular rice, bean, and pork dish that brings good luck and prosperity. It is often served with greens to symbolize wealth and is an absolute must for any modern Southern New Year’s celebration. [^ref164][^ref165] <span eid="Q1810575"> Thiebou niebe,</span> a classic Senegalese dish made similarly from black-eyed peas, rice, and ham, may be the base where the recipe originated.

Hoppin’ John has become symbolic of prosperity for the year ahead, but it originated in the brutal conditions of American plantations. Enslaved workers created new meals from West African recipes and the crops they had access to in the New World. They grew black-eyed peas and other African crops in their subsistence gardens outside the long hours they were forced to labor in their enslaver’s fields. Additionally, enslaved women were often made to cook for the planter’s family as well as their own. White southerners at first saw black-eyed peas as a lowly food meant to feed livestock and the enslaved. To them, the peas seemed to fit in alongside the pork scraps used to cook Hoppin’ John. [^ref168] However, by the latter half of the nineteenth century, white women began including recipes from African descendants in their homemaker cookbooks, often without crediting the women who pioneered them.

Brazil’s national dish, <span eid="Q878189"> _feijoada completa_, </span> has a very similar origin story to Hoppin’ John. Enslaved West Africans in colonial Brazil developed _feijoada_ on plantations out of black beans and scrap pork. [^ref172][^ref173] It was a meal of necessity for workers as it used the food on hand and could be left simmering unattended during the long day’s work. [^ref174] Today, simple bean and rice dishes are a national staple, but _feijoada completa_ is a celebratory meal for every sector of society, taking days to prepare and requiring better meat, collard greens, rice, orange slices, and manioc flour. [^ref175] [^ref176]

For both Hoppin’ John and _feijoada completa_, what was originally a means for survival became a meal for prosperity and celebration, as well as a symbol of unity across racial lines. However, that’s an overly simplistic view of a complex issue. Southern cooking especially can only be viewed as culturally unifying at the surface level. In reality, there is still much tension in questions of representation, ownership, class, race and identity in Southern food and <span eid="Q555997"> Soul Food,</span> with white perspectives usually being unjustly prioritized over Black ones.

## A Food of the Future 
Today, worldwide production of black-eyed peas or cowpeas is hard to estimate as cultivation is still mainly in the hands of small-holder farmers, but also because they are such a staple food that most harvests are used locally rather than being exported. However the FAO estimate around 7 million tonnes are produced annually. [^ref86] The centres of production are still in Africa, the plant’s ancestral home, with Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Tanzania being among the world’s top producers, accounting for 80% of the world’s black-eyed pea crop.[^ref87] It is estimated that it is grown on more than 12 million hectares in many different countries, where it is often intercropped with grains such as sorghum and millet or rice.[^ref88] It is the third most important pulse worldwide, an important element of sustainable agriculture, and feeds hundreds of millions of people.

The black-eyed pea is an often-overlooked 'minor' crop, but soon we may all be more familiar with it. Legumes are emerging as ‘foods of the future’ due to their very nature of being highly nutritious and relatively easy to grow. They will play an important part in future food security – providing food in a changing climate and will continue to help small-scale farmers combat poverty and hunger and improve their livelihoods.[^ref89] As the climate gets warmer and more unpredictable, and as human populations grow and resources become more limited, and as more people aim to eat less meat, legume crops such as black-eyed peas, with their many virtues, will contribute to the diets of more people.[^ref90][^ref91]

Black-eyed peas and other legumes are globally growing in status as a key cooking ingredient. There are hundreds of such recipes readily available online and in cookbooks. Some health-focused cookbooks are regional, aiming to transform, for example, traditional southern recipes like black-eyed peas with pork to leaner, lower-sodium alternatives. [^ref92] Others combine recipes across many cultures, like The Great Vegan Bean Book, which aims to give vegans more options for flavorful meatless protein. These types of cookbooks often marry recipes inspired by the American South with Indian, African, and Caribbean cuisines. [^ref93] [^ref94]

Great natural sources of fiber include: Beans, like navy, pinto, kidney, and black or white. Peas, like split peas, chickpeas, and black-eyed peas. Fruit, like pears, raspberries and prunes. Vegetables, like spinach, carrots, and broccoli. Whole grain cereal, whole grain bread, and whole grain pasta."

Agriculture is already having to adapt to our changing climate, both in terms of practices and in what crops can be grown where. Even though black-eyed peas are considered a very hardy crop, it may struggle as temperatures rise and rains become more erratic with climate change. Crop breeding is one way to make commercial black-eyed peas more resilient, while perhaps also making them more digestible and nutritious. Hardy wild <span eid="Q1141015"> relatives </span> of the black-eyed pea may hold genes or genetic traits that will allow this crop to survive hotter, drier conditions, and perhaps be more pest-resistant.[^ref95] If these traits can be bred into commercial varieties then the black-eyed pea may be one of the answers to the many agricultural challenges of the future.

Over recent decades, significant resources have been put into researching black-eyed peas and their potential. The Crop Wild Relatives Project is one such project in partnership with 33 countries [^ref96] and global seed banks including the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and <span eid="Q2603353"> RBG Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank </span>. There are currently eleven primary wild relatives of the black-eyed pea being researched. Southern and western Africa are hotspots for wild black-eyed pea genetic variation. The importance of such relatives demonstrates how vital it is to protect wild plants and wild habitats for the future for it is here that the answers to our present and future challenges may lie. In a telling [quote](https://www.cwrdiversity.org/cowpea/) from a Nigerian cowpea breeder named Ousame Boukar: “The cowpea has nourished people for many centuries, but now it needs a hand to ensure it can continue to be an unfailing friend even while the climate crisis is affecting production.” Such projects bring us full circle back to the wild plants of Africa, and brings the ancient practices of growing, seed collecting and crop breeding right up to date.
