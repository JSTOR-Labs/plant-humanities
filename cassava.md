## Introduction 
To the right is an earthenware ceramic dating between the 5th and 7th centuries A.D. produced by the [Moche people](https://www.peabody.harvard.edu/node/2505) (1st-8th c. A.D.) in the northern Peruvian coast. The mouth is in the shape of [a stirrup-spout](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/moch/hd_moch.htm), to the front is a human-like head and neck, and the overall form of the legs and body is that of cassava roots. This [work of art](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/308558) carries significant insight into just how highly the Moche valued cassava. Bottles with the stirrup-spout opening are thought to have been used in a non-utilitarian way, such as effigy, ritual or decorative as it is hard to practically use vessels with this type of opening. The iconography evident in the anthropomorphic aspect of this vessel indicate that it is of a high ranking deity. The fangs curling out of the mouth indicate godly status, and the half-crescent headdress indicates a high status. All of these details, accompanied by the fact that the body, tail and limbs of this figure are all modeled after cassava tubers, leads to the conclusion that cassava had a high status and was very important to daily life in Moche civilization.

## Indigenous Food Uses
The native distribution of cassava spans Western South America through Brazil, as indicated by the countries highlighted in green on the map to the right. Based on archaeological evidence, it is thought that cassava was domesticated in small garden plots through several individual events by different people groups living in these areas around 8,000 B.C. From there, domesticated _Manihot esculenta_ spread by other domestication events or through short-distance trade of cuttings or seeds from the plant, rather than by transporting the perishable roots. Because cassava favors warm and hot climes, today it can be found successfully growing in parts of North America, South America, Africa, the Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and islands in the Pacific Ocean.

In Peru, there is evidence from ancient textiles, pottery and archaeobotanical findings that the Moche (A.D. 250-750), Nazca (200 B.C.-A.D. 600)  and Chimú (A.D. 1000-1470) cultures all valued cassava. To the right is a vessel from the Chimú culture depicting cassava roots.

Cassava is a starchy tuber and can be used to make a variety of dishes and beverages. Most commonly it is made into a starchy flour to produce breads and cakes, or it can be used to make fermented beverages. Accounts of native peoples in South America and Latin America producing fermented beverages permeate the records kept by European travellers and conquerors. In the 16th century, a detailed account of the preparation of a fermented alcoholic drink was made by a Frenchman Jean de Léry who visited Brazil, in the early 17th century a Spaniard, Antonio de León Pinelo, kept a very similar account of the process in Peru, and a British duo by the names of Bedford Pim and Berthold Seemann encountered the same process of cassava fermentation in 19th century in Nicaragua.  Depending on the location, the beverage can be called _chicha_, _massato_ (a non-alcoholic variant mixed with honey), _acca_, _kufa_ or _mushla_.

The preparation process for chicha uses several tools.  The basic process is that cassava is either turned into flour or cut, then boiled, chewed and combined with saliva in the mouth for some time, then boiled again in a different vessel, then it is left to ferment for several days until it is ready for consumption. To the right are modern tools used to create chicha in Argentina.This shows that even today people continue to follow the traditional methods established by their ancestors to create fermented cassava beverages.

## Sweet and bitter cassava
Cassava exists in two varieties: sweet and bitter cassava. In their raw forms, both sweet and bitter cassava contain hydrocyanic acid which is toxic to humans. The more bitter the cassava is, the more toxic it is. Making the cassava root safe for consumption continues to be a concern today, especially in developing countries where cassava is a food security crop.
<param ve-plant-specimen jpid="10.5555/al.ap.specimen.us01207392">

Today, these two varieties belong to the same species of cultivated cassava, _Manihot esculenta_. In the past, however, scientists thought they were two different species. Then, bitter cassava was identified as _Manihot utilissima_, and sweet cassava as _Manihot aipi_. An article on cyanogenesis in the 1906 Proceedings of the Royal Society of London outlines the many experimentations which had been conducted on the cassava root to determine its composition. Such endeavours can be traced back as early as the 18th century, when Europeans began to write about methods of extracting the starch from cassava. Before such technologies existed however, Europeans relied upon indigenous knowledge to learn how to process cassava before consumption. 

## Subtitle tbc
The cassava plant is native to Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. It is no surprise then, that some of the earliest descriptions of cassava are found in books written by European travelers to South America.

The method of preparing cassava is illustrated in _Historia naturalis Brasiliae_ (1648), a comprehensive text on Brazilian flora and fauna. It was written by Willem Piso, a Dutch physician and naturalist who travelled with Johan Maurits and the Dutch West India Company to Brazil between 1637 to 1644. Albert Eckhout, an artist on this very same journey, also painted a still-life of the cassava plant, which became one of the earliest paintings of native flora from Brazil in Europe.

Cassava was becoming established as a staple in the West Indies by the 17th century, as described in Maria Sybilla Merian’s _Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium_ (1719). Merian’s meticulously illustrated book describes plants and insects she encountered during her stay in Surinam between 1699 and 1701. Merian describes the cassava root as the ingredient for bread, a common food for both indigenous peoples and Europeans living in America by this time.

## Racism and slavery
Descriptions of cassava in European texts became closely linked to emerging ideas of race as we move from the 18th into the 19th century. Even though earlier texts sometimes feature indigenous peoples working with some form of technology, texts from the late 18th century onwards began to situate indigenous peoples in more primitive-looking landscapes which reduce them to stereotypes. An engraving in Charles Thomas Middleton’s _Geography Systems_ (1769) demonstrates how books during this time applied derogatory terms such as “negroes” to black bodies.

## Diasporic and contemporary food uses

In 1887, American botanist, geologist, and ethnologist William Tufts Brigham published _Guatemala, The Land of the Quetzal_, in which he reported observations from his time in the book’s eponymous region. While visiting the town of Livingston, he describes being invited into people’s homes and witnessing the process of making cassava bread. He first notes the size of the cassava roots (twenty or thirty pounds) and their poisonous juice, before explaining how the bread is made.
 
Instructions for Livingston Cassava Bread:
1.Using a mahogany board with inserted quartz crystal, grate the cassava root into a coarse meal.
2.Wash the meal carefully and partly remove the starch, which will settle in the water as tapioca.
3.Place the meal in a serpiente, or a basket-work sack, which will serve as a press and squeeze the meal.
4.Make the pressed meal into flat loaves roughly three feet in diameter and less than an inch thick.
5.Dry and bake the loaves. 

The result, Brigham reports, is a “wholesome and very nutritious bread, which keeps a long time and is capital on an excursion.” Brigham notes that cassava bread also makes for:
•   “Excellent puddings”
•   A better accompaniment for soup than crackers
•   An indispensable snack in the woods
•   “A capital diet in dyspepsia”
•   A palatable food for sea-sickness that “serves to fill out the bony outlines of an emaciated human frame better than anything else.”
 
Brigham also remarks that cassava bread loaves are attractive and would be easy to export, and suggests they be sold overseas for their dietary benefits.

       fit="cover"

Brigham was not alone in his support of a more expansive cassava industry. Just a few decades before Brigham published Guatemala, the Director of Cultivation of Java ordered a new shipment of cassava to the island. A notable family from the island of Malacca also began  large-scale cultivation of the plant. Indeed, it seems that although there were earlier reports of cassava in Africa in the sixteenth century, it would take a few more centuries for the plant to become popularized beyond South America. English botanist Isaac Henry Burkill similarly observed that “there were two chapters in the establishment of the plant outside its home—one concerned with the carrying of it abroad as a vegetable, and the other with the establishment abroad of its industrial use. A long space of time separated them, as the plant was taken overseas as a vegetable about the year 1500, but the establishment of a tapioca [a cassava byproduct] industry outside America did not follow until two and a half centuries later.” Although it is difficult to ascertain by what routes cassava was taken overseas and exactly when it became popularized outside of South America, by the twentieth century, cassava was being actively grown as a crop in southern North America, central Africa, and South and Southeast Asia.

Here we see a photo of workers in the cassava industry in the Dutch East Indies taken around 1915. Burkill describes the process of making one particular Javanese cassava dish:
1.Peel cassava tubers
2.Steam the inner parts of the tubers
3.Cut steamed inner parts into pieces
4.Sun-dry or pickle the pieces in brine
5.Fry the cassava pieces 

## Conclusion
Today, cassava is still grown in Java, and in other regions around the globe. This resilient, adaptable root with nutritious value has long become an ubiquitous presence in our lives, from tapioca school pudding to bubble tea. People all over the world continue to reinvent its meaning and connect to cassava in their own ways. Nigerian-American artist Njideka Akyunyili Crosby has featured cassava prominently in her work as she explores the ability of people, plants, and paintings to inhabit multiple spaces. For Crosby, cassava has a specific association with village life in Nigeria. In her painting _Cassava Garden_, she juxtaposes it with an Indian rubber tree from her life in Los Angeles to create an imagined garden where two plants that are not usually found together can coexist. Ultimately, she uses cassava and the Indian rubber tree to ask, “when does something belong to a place?”
