## MapWarper

[MapWarper](https://mapwarper.net/) is a free and open-source tool for **georectification**.  Georectification is the process of taking an image of a map and referencing it to a spatial grid, so that the image of the map can be used as a layer in other maps, or so that the image of the map can in turn be used for associating points of interest with the spatial grid.  For visual essays this is often used to generate historical map overlays for geographical regions of interest.
 
 In the screen shot below the rectification process is depicted in the MapWarper tool.  Pins are used to associate reference points in the historical map in the left pane with points on the spatial map in the right pane.

## Geojson.io

[geojson.io/](http://geojson.io/) is an online tool for generating GeoJSON files.  GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures and supports the following geometry types:  `Point`,  `LineString`,  `Polygon`,  `MultiPoint`,  `MultiLineString`, and  `MultiPolygon`. Geometric objects with additional properties are  `Feature`  objects. Sets of features are contained by  `FeatureCollection`  objects.  It is based on the [JavaScript Object Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Object_Notation "JavaScript Object Notation") (JSON).  GeoJSON features can be added as layers on visual essay maps to show areas of interest.  The GeoJSON features can also be linked with referencing passages in the essay text.
