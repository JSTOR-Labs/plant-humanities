[**Agave - An Ancient Plant with an Intoxicating History**](/Agave)

- author: Ashley Buchanan, PhD
- date: 2020

1698 was a special year for the Leiden botanical garden. After 96 long years, its exotic “Aloe Americana” (or _Agave americana_ as it is classified today) bloomed for the first time. To commemorate the marvelous event, the Hortus commissioned and illustrated print of the plant. A surviving poster-sized print, recently added to Dumbarton Oaks’ Rare Book Collection, reveals sixteenth and seventeenth century European botanists’ fascination with the so-called “century plant” and provides a lens to explore the history of agave – a plant that shaped human societies across three continents.

[**Arbor Vitae - Thuja occidentalis**](/arbor_vitae)

In his 1640 herbal, John Parkinson described the “tree of life,” or “arbor vitæ,” as "a tall tree being similar to a cypress and covered by a dark reddish bark on the trunk and an even redder bark on the branches." Parkinson went on to explain that the tree, unknown to the ancients, originated in the New World and was introduced to Europe by the French. He explained that while it was presented to the French King, Francis I, as the “tree of life” (arbor vitæ) he had no idea why. Clearly, Parkinson was unaware of the miraculous stories associated with the arbor vitæ.

[**Chaos out of Order – Bananas and the Limits of Linnaean Taxonomy**](/Banana)

- author: Ashley Buchanan, PhD

Everybody knows what a banana is. At least we think we do. Today, the banana is a ubiquitous and easy-to-recognize fruit that even shares the same name or sounds the same in many modern languages. Yet, despite the fact that you can identify the word for banana across cultures, the actual identification and classification of our modern-day banana is, to quote a popular idiom, “bananas.” It is a genetically modified mystery that continues to defy our system of plant taxonomy.

[**Cacao: An indigenous network and global commodity**](/cacao)

- author: Rebecca Friedel

One of the most salient indigenous networks that colonial Europeans made efforts to control was that of cacao, _Theobroma cacao_. While such endeavors are often conceptualized as a one-way street, with colonizers subjugating the colonized, the historical picture is more complex.  The early modern period saw Europeans seeking to benefit from new economic goods and networks in the Americas. Yet, economies do not function in a vacuum and, to truly benefit, they had to assimilate into the other cultural spheres of foreign lands. This meant learning about native perspectives and knowledge, which Europeans exploited for their own benefit both in the New World and eventually back in their homelands, ultimately ‘globalizing’ pre-existing indigenous networks. The primary sources from this initial period of interaction document the knowledge gained from native populations of the Americas about the coveted plant known to produce the infamous _xocoatl_.

Carolina Rice, the “heritage grain” lost to history in the post-antebellum era, has come back in a major way. Indeed, in a [2017 article](https://www.eater.com/ad/15973794/carolina-gold-rice-heritage-grains), _Eater_ declared that “The Grain Revolution is Here,” describing one company’s attempt to bring back the historical strain of Oryza sativa. Varieties of Carolina Rice, in particular, the “Carolina Gold” strain, have been attracting the attention of niche cooking websites and standard news sources alike, with outlets from [_Serious Eats_](https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/05/)

[**The Corpse Flower - Amorphophallus titanium**](/Corpse_Flower)

- author: Ashley Buchanan, PhD

![](https://dev.visual-essays.app/thumbnail?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Corpse_flower_%2871304%29f.jpg)
  
In the late afternoon of a hot summer day in June 2019, an extraordinary and rare flower began to bloom at the New York Botanic Garden (NYBG). A press release was immediately sent out as visitors had only 24 to 36 hours to the see the world’s largest inflorescence (flower-bearing structure) in peak bloom. It was not just the size of the _Amorphophallus titanium_, however, that would attract hundreds of thousands of visitors. It was also the fact that, as its common name “corpse flower” suggests, this gigantic plant, when in bloom, smells like rotting flesh.

[**The ubiquity of mint**](/mint)

- author: Victoria Pickering PhD

![](https://dev.visual-essays.app/thumbnail?url=https://github.com/JSTOR-Labs/plant-humanities/raw/master/images/mint.jpg) 
  
Some scents regularly appear in our daily lives and give us a sense of familiarity. Mint is one such example of a ubiquitous plant, and one that we think we know. The strong scent and taste of mint, the notable green leaves with serrated edges, and the broad consumer uses of this plant that are so common to us today (such as toothpaste and chewing gum), obscures the lesser known fact that mint has a more nuanced history of naming and identification.

[**Peony: From an Ancient Cure to an Early Modern Tool of Statecraft**](/Peony)

- author: Ashley Buchanan, PhD and Kyra Krakos, PhD

In 1735, a Viennese baroness wrote to the last Medici princess, Anna Maria Luisa de Medici (1669-1743),  to thank her for sending a miraculous infant convulsion powder. In her letter, the baroness praised the powder’s effectiveness and stated that the children she treated with it had been so violently taken by convulsions that the physicians had “given up on them.” Not only had the “miraculous powder” cured the children, the baroness also stated that a number of months had passed, and the children remained in perfect health. Anna Maria Luisa was well known for her miraculous powder, which she distributed strategically to influential individuals and courts across Europe.

[**Turmeric**](/turmeric)

- author: Julia Fine

![](https://dev.visual-essays.app/thumbnail?url=https://images.nypl.org/index.php?id=1126115&t=w)
  
Turmeric’s status as a valuable medicinal plant has long been mythologized. Indeed, many juggernauts, including the _Oxford English Dictionary_, suggest that its etymology stems from an adulteration of the French trade-name “terre mérite.” Dr. William Guthrie, in a 2008 article, all but proved this etymology to be spurious, but it nonetheless illustrates how the root has been seen across the centuries: it is a plant of extreme value (mérite) from the earth (la terre).
