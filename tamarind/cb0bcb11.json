According to legend, Krishna, after being separated from Radha, experienced an intense spiritual epiphany when sitting under a tamarind tree. The series of images featured here, all hand-painted in 17th-century India by various artists, illustrate Radha and Krishna in the company of dense foliage, including tamarind trees. ",
