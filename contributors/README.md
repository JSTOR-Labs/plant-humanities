## Thomas C. Anderson

[Thomas C. Anderson]()

![](Anderson.jpg)

Anderson’s research, which draws upon both historical archival studies as well as plant biology and botany, explores how early modern colonial encounters with the natural world helped shape our modern pharmacopoeia. To the early modern naturalist and explorer, the keys to life’s greatest mysteries were to be found in the petals, leaves, and anthers of strange and exotic plants. Amerindian horticultural, botanical, and art-historical contributions to this complicated and multifaceted story have only recently emerged as a subject of scholarly interest. Anderson uses the history of medicine and botany to help elucidate the unknown pasts that have nonetheless had a major impact on the construction of scientific and medical knowledge up to today. Anderson is a master’s candidate at Columbia University. He holds a bachelor’s in history and French and Francophone Studies from Hamilton College. Anderson has explored transoceanic acclimatization and the indigenous Guanche pharmacopoeia in the Canary Islands; the early modern history of imperial science and medicine in Paris; ethnobotany and plant taxonomy at the New York Botanical Gardens; historical manuscripts concerning colonial plants and their uses at the John Carter Brown Library; and toxicity and plant defense systems at Cornell University.

## Verónica Matallana Chaves

[Verónica Matallana Chaves]()

![](Chaves.jpg)

Matallana Chaves’s undergraduate thesis research focuses on the history of textile work in Colombia and the use of natural fibers with a botanical-historical approach. Given the country’s sociocultural diversity, material cultural objects with an artisan trajectory play a key role in the consolidation of identities and symbolic networks. Although these objects have a consolidated historical trajectory, their agency has been changing as they have been touched by the dynamics of conservation, commodification, and resignification. Her work brings these points of tension and breakdowns in craft traditions to the surface. Chaves is in her third year of the undergraduate program in history at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where she has participated in projects on digital history, environmental history, and oral history and memory. She is currently part of the Public and Digital History group and is linked to the Laboratory of Historical Cartography and Digital History.

## Rachel Hirsch

[Rachel Hirsch]()

![](hirsch.jpg)

What was it that made the gardens constructed throughout the Mughal Empire (1526–1857) such as Burhanpur’s Lal Bagh so appealing to these otherwise disgruntled travelers? What can we glean about their plant composition, function, and reception from textual, visual, and material sources? These and other related questions drive Hirsch’s current research on the art and architectural history of early modern South Asia. Her goal is to characterize perceptions of land and their relationship to the changing forms and functions of gardens in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Ultimately, by underscoring the historical connections between humans, plants, and cultural production, she hopes to generate new understandings of territory in the early modern period.
Rachel Hirsch is a PhD candidate in history of art and architecture at Harvard University and a cultural historian of early modern South Asia. Her research interests include urban construction, perceptions of land and territory, garden history, and the potential for new art historical methods and sources.

Amara Santiesteban is a biologist specializing in botany from the Autonomous University of Madrid (Spain). She holds an MSc in Tropical Biodiversity and Conservation, where she entered the world of Plant Humanities by studying the expedition of the XVIII century naturalist Alexander von Humboldt to the Canary Islands (Spain). Santiesteban was also granted during this period a JAE Intro fellowship at the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid, where she was given the opportunity to untangle the complex taxonomy of the tropical plant family of the Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa, Lecythidaceae). Currently, she has been awarded a Ph.D. contract to conduct her research on the effects of wildfires on mycorrhizal fungi and their impact on plants, but she is determined to keep on working on a multidisciplinary approach of plant sciences where the local knowledge, art, literature, and naturalism walk side by side. The Dumbarton Oaks Summer Program provided the perfect ground for this young researcher to take off in this new stage of her academic career.
