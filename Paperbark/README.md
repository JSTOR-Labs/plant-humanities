### Introduction: A Fall from Grace
Throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, one could trace the expansion of colonial rule in Hong Kong along the treeline. British accounts of the pre-colonial landscape abound with assessments of bleak barrenness, of sun-scorched rocky topography divested of trees and life in general. The land, increasingly inscribed with moralized ideals, was at best inhospitable and at worst “primitive.”[^1] The self-identified task of the British colonial government was to plant trees for multipronged effect: to cultivate shade and health in the dangerous tropical heat, and to temper the barren ‘wild’ of the Indigenous landscape, moving it steadily toward an ideal imported from the forested English countryside.[^2] The newly formed Botanical and Afforestation Department approached this assignment voraciously, planting hundreds of thousands of trees a year for much of the twentieth century.[^3] Most of the species chosen to fill the rocky ridges were sourced from climatic neighbors of Hong Kong, such as northeastern Australia, New Caledonia, and the island of New Guinea.[^4] One such tree was the broad-leaf Paperbark species *Melaleuca quinquenervia* which can still be found lining streets in urban zones and as part of wetland ecosystems.[^5]

### 
A similar tale of afforestation drives further histories of the paperbark and can be implicated in its transformation from a treasured specimen tree to pernicious weed. Early twentieth-century developers in South Florida likewise employed the rhetoric of a wasteland ripe with latent potential, one that could be unlocked with the aid of trees’ shade and fast-growing roots.[^6] For decades, agriculturalists lauded *M. quinquenervia* as the tree that would dry up the Everglades, converting the putrid swamp into productive farmland. Local and federal horticultural agencies subsidized its planting and cultivation, even broadcasting its seed from low-flying planes across acres of swamp.[^7] So highly prized was the paperbark for both its utility and ornamental value that early seed importers jostled to be recognized as its first American planters.[^8] A [memorial plaque in Lange Park,](https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/f7crBJDVxfJVFvPLAumHwA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2g9NzUwO3E9ODA7dz0xMDAw/https://s.yimg.com/bj/52ab/52abdf0d1887ac317a71dbbf16b3eea4.jpg) less than ten miles east of the Everglades, boasts that a *Melaleuca* planted there in 1900 by John C. Lange to be the oldest in the region. Towering over 25 meters prior to a lightning strike in 1990, it also came to be the tallest, for which it was awarded listed status as a so-called 'champion tree' by the American Forestry Association of 1981.[^9]

The broad-leaf paperbark of Lange Park is emblematic of the species’ swift and steep fall from grace: from champion tree to incorrigible pest. "This is a living monument that needs to die", insisted Broward County Environmental executive, Patti Webster, only a decade following its national honor.[^10] "It's a tribute to what not to plant. [...] We'd be better off with a picture of it instead of the tree".[^11] These later comments follow a series of laws passed in the 1990s and designed to eliminate the species’ presence in southern Florida. Botanists increasingly concerned for its dominance in the Everglades now enlist terms of war to describe its reproduction. To Jonathan Silvertown, in his Demons in Eden (2005), the *M. quinquenervia* is part of an "army" that "arrived with a vengeance and is advancing mercilessly across Florida's natural ecosystems". It is a villainous identity difficult to square with the paperbark’s long history as a treasure of Aboriginal culture and bushcraft. How did this tree come to trace such a capricious path in its human alliances?

### Colonial Discovery 
The *Melaleuca quinquenervia* belongs to a genus of the Myrtle family, closely related to the Eucalyptus, and endemic to mainland Australia, New Caledonia, and Indonesia, its southern geographical limit reaching Botany Bay. As its common name suggests, *Melaleucas* are distinctive for their bark, which easily peels from the truck in smooth, flat sheets. The *M. quinquenervia*, one of a group of up to 100 species described as "broadleaf", can grow to heights of 20 meters. It favors riverbanks, swamps, floodplains, and estuaries. Its flowers, which appear in the fall, range from white to cream, and, characteristically of *Melaleucas*, comprise spiked clusters of petals from which it derives an additional common name: "bottle-brush tree". *M. quinquenervia* specimens feature dark, gray-green leaves. The name *quinquenervia* is taken from the Latin words for five (quinque) and veins (nervia), describing the five veins typically found upon the plant’s leaves. As a fire-adapted species, burning can be beneficial to *Melaleucas*. Stress from the fire causes seed release and creates an ideal environment for seed germination and seedling growth with a more open canopy and carbon-rich soil.

The *Melaleuca* genus was identified in 1750 by Carl Linnaeus based on observations of specimens collected by the earlier German-born botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius (1627-1702) on the Indonesian Maluku Islands in the 1660s, during his employment with the Dutch East India Company. Famed as “the Pliny of the Indies,” Rumphius’ botanical work, *Herbarium Amboinense* (1741), was published decades posthumously against all odds—despite the author’s acquired blindness late in life (as shown in the frontispiece portrait), the loss of his library and earliest manuscript draft to a fire, and a subsequent loss of a completed manuscript in a shipwreck.[^12]

In the *Herbarium Amboinense*, a work based on which Linnaeus was able to classify dozens of new genera, Rumphius describes a type of Myrtle tree, known in the native Malay as “Caju-puti”, to which he adds the Latin Arbor alba (white tree) and Dutch “Witte Boom.” He also provides an additional synonym, “Brant-Boomen” (fire tree), noting the apparent mystery that, though no witness had ever seen the tree on fire, “the bottom of this trunk is always most black, as if it had been burnt,”[^13] which suggested to Rumphius that the heat of summer sun would scorch the dry and delicate bark without actually bursting into flame.

Rumphius’ account of the paperbark’s appearance following a bushfire, its white, flakey bark patchy under a scorched outer layer, is inscribed in the tree’s name, *Melaleuca*, as given to it by Linnaeus, taken from the Greek “mélas” (black) and “leukós” (white). It remains a strong association with the tree for those familiar with it. In a recent [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot_and_Olivier_in_America) Australian novelist Peter Carey depicts a character, disfigured by burns, whose “pale blue eyes peered out from his own tattered skin as if they were prisoners inside the trunk of a blackened antipodean paperbark.”[^14]

The *quinquenervia* species of *Melaleuca* received formal botanical description only in 1797 by the Spanish naturalist Antonio José Cavanilles.[^15] But it also numbered among the plants that had been earlier observed and collected by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, the latter a student of Linnaeus, who traveled to so-called “Botany Bay” on Captain Cook’s HMS Endeavour between 1768 and 1771, returning to England with over 3,600 botanical specimens. A specimen of *M. quinquenervia* collected in Bustard Bay and formerly identified as *M. leucadendra* before its reclassification in 1968, is preserved in the Queensland herbarium.[^16] The species is also included among the engravings of Banks’ *Florilegium*, a work that, despite 13 years of labor and enormous personal expense (costing £7,000, or roughly $1,490,000 today), remained unpublished until 1990.[^17]

### Indigenous Treasure 
The paperbark’s centrality to Indigenous communities predates its eighteenth-century “discovery” by thousands of years. The tree goes by countless names across the Australian continent: in Bibbulmun, spoken by the south-western Noongar peoples, it is known as the “Mudrooroo”; in the northern languages of Ngalakgan and Kunwinjku, it is the “Gu-got” and “Kun-kod", respectively.[^18] To a vast number of Indigenous peoples, including those of New Caledonia and New Guinea, the paperbark is no villain. In sharp contrast to its current status in the United States, it continues to hold a pivotal role among Aboriginal cultures.

*Melaleuca* has many uses that intersect with daily life, as a source of food, medicine, fuel, and protection from the elements. The bark can be easily peeled from the tree and used for shelter construction, fuel, lumber, wrapping food, lining earth ovens, bundling babies, and as an antiseptic-laden bandage. The hardy trees also have environmental benefits, including soil conservation, windbreaking, erosion control, and providing habitats and sustenance for a multitude of organisms. Birds, bats, and invertebrates are among the creatures that live or feast upon paperbark trees.

### 
Part of what attracted European botanists and explorers to the paperbark was the many medicinal applications of the tree. A tea brewed from young bruised leaves is drunk for headaches and general sickness. The leaf oil has been used to treat respiratory ailments, colds, and rheumatism and has antiseptic properties used to treat cuts and sores.[^19] Ironically, in the United States, *M. quinquenervia* has been labeled an allergen and respiratory irritant. Florida authorities used human health concerns to justify the 1990 ban on the sale, transportation, collection, cultivation, or possession of *Melaleuca*.[^20] More recently, studies have found *M. quinquenervia* is actually not a significant source of aeroallergen or a respiratory irritant.[^21] The essential oil produced by *M. quinquenervia* is used by many as an antibacterial, fungicide, and insect repellant, often intended to treat superficial skin conditions. However, modern producers derive commercially available tea tree oil from *M. alternifolia*, not *M. quinquenervia*. Commonly known as Niaouli, some sellers market the oil from the *M. quinquenervia* as having more robust properties than the more common tea tree oil.

For generations, the Indigenous populations of Oceania have used *Melaleuca* bark to build structures and dwellings. Among some groups, dwellings were built entirely by women who cut the bark, erected the structure, and carried the components on their backs when traveling.[^22] Paperbark sheeting was stored when not in use and, unavailable in some areas, sometimes had to be transported over considerable distances.[^23] Bark structures could range from rafts for fishing, an important Indigenous tradition across much of Oceania, open-air huts, as well as more substantive constructions intended as shelters against the wet season's rains. Australian oral history from the Wik-Mungkan people, an Aboriginal group from northern Queensland, includes a tale regarding the origins of paperbark dwellings.[^24] The story tells of a man and woman out foraging who, when caught by surprise by the fast-approaching rainy season, construct one of the first *Melaleuca* bark shelters. Aside from the bark, *Melaleuca* lumber—hard and fine textured, and naturally resistant to termite attacks— is considered a good building material, though liable to warp and challenging to cut and season.

Ethnographic accounts describe countless further uses of Aboriginal Australians using *Melaleuca* bark. It served for bedding, lining earth ovens, wrapping food for cooking and storage, as fuelwood or kindling, and making liquid holding vessels and baskets.[^25] More recently, Euro-Australians have also championed the culinary applications of the paperbark tree in combination with other Indigenous ingredients. Paperbark sheets intended for cooking are now commercially available. Chefs note that food cooked while wrapped in paperbark takes on a smoky flavor and recommend this method for roasting fish, chicken, or vegetables. The plant’s culinary uses extend beyond the *Melaleuca* bark. For example, steeping *Melaleuca* tree blossoms creates a natural sweetener, which has been used for candies.[^26] *M. quinquenervia* is a fine source of nectar and pollen for bees and is a significant source of honey in Australia and Florida.

Paperbark provided women with a versatile utilitarian material. Not only was *Melaleuca* ideal for building and cooking, but women incorporated the bark into the traditional birthing practices and the early care of infants.[^27] In fact, for some Aboriginal Australians, childbirth occurred over a bark-lined pit, and then the newly born baby was wrapped in paperbark or placed in a paperbark-lined coolamon (a basin-like vessel).

As a result, Aboriginal Australians were born into paperbark, lived in paperbark, ate from paperbark, and used paperbark for everything from ritual crafts to repelling insects. They incorporated paperbark into every phase of life, including funerary rituals, using it as a writing medium and for smoking, shelter, and transportation. It is no wonder that the paperbark tree lives on in the minds of contemporary Australians and serves as a symbol of Aboriginal resilience.

Aboriginal Australians value paperbark so highly that some have incorporated it into their names. The most famous of those is Oodgeroo Noonuccal (1920-1993), an Aboriginal Australian activist, educator, and artist. Formerly known as Kath Walker, the new name she adopted in 1988 translates as “paperbark tree of the Noonuccal”, her ancestral tribe. Noonuccal devoted her life to combating social inequality for the indigenous and advocating for the environment. Her writing explores themes of cultural identity, spirituality, place and time, interwoven with rich descriptions of Australia’s natural environment. Her poem “Oodgeroo” tells the story of a woman, severed from her culture and people who, with the help of Biami the Good Spirit, spent many years recording lost tribal stories on paperbark. It concludes with the female protagonist finding peace in a tribe of paperbark trees, free from her old foe, Time.[^28] “Oodgeroo” is exemplary in its exploration of ecological symbiosis, capturing both the *Melaleuca*’s utility and kinship with Aboriginal communities.

### Climate Change and Indigenous Management 
In a time of unprecedented wildfires and biodiversity loss, governments, institutions, and individuals are reevaluating how human behavior shapes natural environments. In Australia, climate change is creating hotter average temperatures and a more extended fire season while increasing the likelihood of bushfires, droughts, floods, sea level rise, and extreme temperatures.[^29] Like many other countries, Australia currently faces environmental challenges that stem not only from global climatic change but also from a legacy of colonial land management and the displacement of Indigenous peoples.

###
Before the arrival of Europeans in Oceania, Indigenous peoples shaped their landscapes by facilitating the growth of specific flora, including *Melaleuca*. Pollen, charcoal, and dendrochronological records indicate that the environment of Australia before the eighteenth century required active management by Aboriginal Australians.[^30] Key environmental modifications include anthropogenic burning, wind-and water-induced soil erosion following the removal or alteration of vegetation, irrigation, drained wetlands, redirected waterways, fertilizer use, and the introduction and exploitation of specific flora and fauna.[^31] One of the most powerful tools for land management is anthropogenic or prescribed burning, The fires typically cover small areas of land, herding animals while burning grasses and underbrush. The heat and lack of competition encourage the growth of a heterogeneous range of annual vegetation, creating ecologically diverse patches. Small and frequently prescribed burning can reduce the chances of subsequent high-severity wildfires.[^32] To promote more sustainable practices, Australians have worked to reincorporate elements of Indigenous land management. For instance, the Ngarrindjeri Nation in South Australia has negotiated with the State Government to be recognized as a sovereign partner in environmental management and implemented a program that facilitates continued collaboration, training, and the protection of the sites’ cultural value.[^33] Federal funding has supported the replacement of non-native flora with *M. quinquenervia* and other endemic species native to eastern Australia, including tuckeroo and lomandra.[^34]

### An Advancing Enemy in Florida 
The global dispersal of the paperbark tree was accompanied by a patchy and incomplete knowledge transference. Western horticulturalists, like those in Florida, recognized a sparse few of the multitude of Aboriginal uses. At the turn of the twentieth century, nurserymen and regional planters in and around the Everglades saw potential in the *M. quinquenervia* as a timber species as well as a land management tool; as mentioned previously, they posited that its high water usage and its fast-growing speed would make it ideal for converting the swamp into a dry and “productive” agricultural landscape while eradicating mosquitos and other pests.[^35] The tree’s thick roots were utilized as a natural erosion-prevention infrastructure and were thus employed to stabilize disturbed areas, especially around Lake Okeechobee.[^36] Finally, especially in its early years, the paperbark was appreciated as an ornamental and was planted as such in gardens around south Florida.[^37] Today, scientists recognize another utility for *M. quinquenervia* as a climate recorder. The tree’s leaves can provide proxy data for quantifying past rainfall.[^38] Although limited in its uses when compared to its endemic range, the paperbark entered Florida as an appreciated and valuable addition. This positive image accompanied the tree for much of the twentieth century.

As the twentieth century came to a close, so did the paperbark’s era of good grace. Many of the traits that made the tree initially attractive became those for which it is now most despised. *M. quinquenervia* grows quickly and is a prolific reproducer, with some mature plants holding up to 20 million seeds at a time. If contained within their capsules, these can remain viable for up to 10 years and germinate in various conditions.[^39] South Florida and the tree’s endemic zone both fall within subtropical latitudes and share a climate of high precipitation in the summer and mild temperatures combined with low precipitation in the winter. Both habitats experience frequent wildfires and have histories of indigenous anthropogenic burning. These traits make *M. quinquenervia* preadapted to thrive in Florida, which it certainly did immediately upon its introduction.[^40] Its seeds established themselves within south Florida’s many wetland environments with efficiency and ease. By 1994, estimates of the paperbark spread had surpassed 500,000 acres of Floridian land, most of which was comprised of monocultural stands.[^41]

Militaristic analogies reenter the narrative of the Paperbark tree in discussions of controlling its spread.  Attempts to push back the edges of *M. quinquenervia* groves are described in the language of battles and outright war between humans, accompanied by their army of emissaries, and the ever-encroaching, anthropomorphized enemy, the tree.  Battle tactics are aggressive and varied, including cutting, herbicides, burning, flooding, hand removal of individual saplings, and, increasingly, biological control.[^42] A 1997 article in *The New York Times* speaks of a valiant “Army of Tree-Hungry Beetles” ready for employment in the battle against the insidious paperbark. The text celebrates *Oxyops vitiosa*, a snout beetle also native to Eastern Australia, which was released in the late 1990s to colonize stands of the species in South Florida, in the hopes that the weevils, who feed primarily on the fresh leaves of saplings, would keep the further expansion of the tree at bay.[^43] In the decades since their introduction, other insects like *Lophodiplosis trifida*, *Fergusonina turneri*, and others have been studied and eventually released for their possible usefulness in this ongoing “war.”[^44]

It is a small jump from this metaphorical battle to one between nations. In what the botanist Tim Low termed one of the ironies of the broad-leaf paperbark’s invasive speed, the native habitats of this tree are increasingly under threat. Writing in 1990, Low reported how he “trudged across the bulldozed fields” in south-east Queensland, shaking his head in dismay as he thought back to his “American friends, and how they would love to see a scene like this acted out in Florida.” These areas of Australian wetland are fast being developed for human habitation. And even in still preserved wilderness, the tree faces ecological challenges. In the greatest irony of all, among the threats to the paperbark in its Australian habitat is the Pond Apple native to the Everglades, (*Annona glabra*). It is difficult not to conceive of this development as an act of botanical revenge.[^45]

### Conclusion:
Should this framing of conflict and warfare give us pause for thought? The label “invasive”, as a scientific term applied to an organism, has its mainstream origins in zoologist Charles Elton’s 1958 work, *The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants*, and caught on broadly only in the 1990s, when publications on “invasives” skyrocketed.[^46] In 1994, Hawai’i’s Senator Daniel Akaka spoke before Congress about the “slow, silent invasion of alien pests'' creeping across United States borders.[^47] By 1999, this concern had gained such traction that an executive order mandated the formation an inter-agency government coalition, the “National Invasive Species Council'', to eradicate botanical threats.[^48] Around the same time, several scholars of landscape design turned a critical eye to the tenor of this discourse and the countervailing enthusiasm for “native plants'', a term that constitutes a “mixture of sound biology, invalid ideas, false extensions, ethical implications and political usage both intended and unanticipated”.[^49] In particular, Joachim Wolschke Bulmahn and Gert Gröning have sought to trace this discourse to ideologies of landscape under nazi Germany and American “nativism” in the early twentieth century. How easily, they ask, can the scientific become political? Can these conceptions of landscape feed xenophobia?[^50]

These questions have necessarily faced pushback. In the case of the paperbark, after all, the ecological reality of its dominance in Florida cannot be denied, regardless of the language used to describe its spread. This debate is nevertheless part of the paperbark tree’s history. Its vilification arose at the same moment toward the end of the twentieth century. Just as “invasives” were entering mainstream consciousness as ecological villains, the USDA placed *Melaleuca quinquenervia* on the Federal Noxious Weed List, restricting its sale, circulation, and importation throughout the United States.[^51] In the later part of the 1990s, this zeal for prevention morphed into one for eradication, and significant sums of money, from both federal agencies and NGOs, were put towards removing pre-existing stands in Florida. Legislation supported by its invasive status began to imply that nearly anything, including development, was preferable to the presence of the tree.[^52] In the space of a century, *M. quinquenervia* had fallen from a plant of immense possibility to an invasive, “garbage” weed. Nothing in the plant had changed; it continues to live and reproduce as it did at the moment of its first Western description. What did shift, however, was our illusion of control. The tree escaped the settings and roles that Floridian planters had hoped to consign it to, serving as a bitter reminder that human interests are but one force shaping our dynamic, global environment.
