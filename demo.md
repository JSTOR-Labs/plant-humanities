## Introduction

<param title="Washington, D. C." eid="Q61" fill="#FF0000" marker-symbol="landmark">

Cherry blossoms have formed an integral part of the identity of Washington, D. C., ever since Japan gifted over three thousand cherry trees to the United States in 1912 as a symbol of friendship and political alliance. Until the final decades of the 19th century, Japanese cherry trees had often been misunderstood among Westerners, and garnered only modest attention in Europe. Subsequent European involvement in East Asia forced Japan, which had pursued a strict isolationist policy for centuries, to open its borders. As a result, Europeans enjoyed greater contact with Japanese culture, and a growing interest in cherry blossoms. With the planting of Japan’s gift of cherry trees in the <span id="Q956781">Tidal Basin</span>, cherry blossoms became accessible to the American public, entering Western consciousness on an unprecedented scale.

## Cherry Trees in Japan

<param title="Japan" eid="Q17">

The cherry blossom has been a repository of symbolism in Japanese culture for centuries: it has variously symbolized processes of life, death, reproductive power, love, rebirth, and the beauty of impermanence. By the end of the Edo period (1603-1868) cherry blossoms came to be a dominant symbol of Japanese identity, although their association with Japanese identity dates to at least the ninth century. During the early years of Japan’s rapid industrialization, cherry trees fell prey to an iconoclastic drive to erase reminders of the old feudal society. As Japan continued to negotiate its national identity, cherries were taken up again, now as symbols of a modern Japan that would be recognizable on an international scale. In the years leading up to World War II, the image of falling cherry blossoms, which had traditionally been associated with impermanence and death, was increasingly deployed to aestheticize self-sacrifice for the emperor. Cherry blossoms were planted in shrines glorifying fallen soldiers, and featured prominently in military imagery.

### Cherry viewing in Japan

Flower-viewing or hanami is a centuries-old practice in Japan. Flower viewing started in imperial circles in the eighth century, when the Japanese elite eagerly adopted Chinese high culture. Chinese plum blossoms were initially the object of viewing parties. By the ninth century, hanami was practically synonymous with viewing cherry blossoms, as Japanese elites sought to delineate a distinctly Japanese identity. In the 18th century, mass plantings were made in poor riverside districts of present-day Tokyo, many of which were notorious for prostitution, gambling, and licentious theater. Plantings of cherry trees were meant to beautify riverside communities, which the government considered eyesores. These mass plantings helped make cherry-viewing a popular pastime across all classes. Both new cherry-picnic sites and sites historically famous for imperial outings became widely popular spots for drink, merry-making and the loosening of social conventions.

## Cherries in the West

Before the craze for Japanese cherries in the West at the start of the twentieth century, Europeans knew little of Japanese cherry blossoms, and Westerners who visited Japan often complained of how flowering Japanese cherry trees bore no fruit. As shipping techniques improved in the early 19th century, Japanese cherries began to trickle into European gardens in 1832, but remained unfashionable until the 1870s. When Japan opened its borders, greater contact with Japanese culture fueled interest in cherry blossoms among Westerners. By the 1890’s, Japan was marketing and exporting cherry trees to the West. However, cherries did not reach wide audiences in the West until Japan gave thousands of cherry trees to the United States in the early 20th century.  According to the World Atlas[^wa] the top 5 cherry producing countries in 2017 were Turkey, the United States, Iran, Spain, and Italy.

### Cherries in D.C.

In 1912, Japan gifted thousands of cherry trees to the United States as a gesture of friendship. A previous shipment, made in 1909, was burned upon entry into the United States when it was discovered that the trees were infected. The trees from 1912 prospered, becoming a beloved part of the city and an enduring symbol of the United States’ relationship with Japan. Most of the trees in the Tidal Basin were of the Yoshido variety, or Prunus x yedoensis. There are ongoing efforts to preserve the few surviving cherries from 1912 as witnesses to Washington’s history.

### Cherries at Dumbarton Oaks

Located in the Northeastern corner of Dumbarton Oaks, Cherry Hill is planted with the Japanese cherry varieties Prunus sargentii, Prunus subhirtella, and Prunus x yedoensis, the most abundant cherry in the Tidal Basin. Fruit-bearing black cherries, Prunus serotina, can also be found in the gardens. By isolating a large grouping of cherries on Cherry Hill, landscape architect Beatrix Farrand created a space devoted to the display of cherry blossoms that would not be a conspicuous part of the gardens when not in bloom.

## The Great Lakes Fruit Belt

Fruit Belt[^glfb] is a term in the United States for an area where the microclimate provides good conditions for fruit growing.  Fruit Belts are prominent around the North American Great Lakes region, notably West Michigan (Fruit Ridge) and western Northern Lower Michigan in tandem, and the southern shore of Lake Erie. The conditions that produce a micro-climate favorable to fruit cultivation are the same that produce lake-effect snow; therefore, Fruit Belts and snowbelts are often concurrent. The map at right shows Great Lakes snowbelts which cover a somewhat larger area than the fruit belt.  A Fruit Belt also exists in Central <span eid="Q1223">Washington</span> State.  Berries are grown on the West Coast.

### Cherry Production in Michigan

<param ve-map center="Q984544" zoom="7">

Cherry production in Michigan[^cpm] is a major part of the agriculture industry in the state. Harvesting over 90,000 tons of cherries each year, Michigan is the nation's leading producer of tart cherries. The Montmorency cherry is the variety of tart, or sour, cherry most commonly grown in the state. A Hungarian sour cherry cultivar, Balaton, has been commercially produced in Michigan since 1998.
<param ve-map-layer geojson url="geojson/great-lakes-fruit-belt.json" title="Great Lakes Fruit Belt" active>

The Fruit Belt (also called the Fruit Ridge) of western Michigan, and, in particular, the Grand Traverse Bay region, produce most of the state's cherries. Michigan's cherry industry is highly vulnerable to a late spring frost, which can wipe out a season's harvest. This occurred most recently in 2012, when over 90% of the crop was lost.

### National Cherry Festival

The National Cherry Festival[^ncf] is a festival in Traverse City, Michigan. It began in 1925 as the Blessing of the Blossoms Festival, which was held in early May to attract tourists to Northern Michigan to view the blooming cherry blossoms. In 1931 the Michigan Legislature renamed the festival the National Cherry Festival, and moved the event to the summer. Since 2004, a May event coinciding with blooming of the cherry blossoms is also held again, as the Blossom Days Festival, in addition to what is now the better-known National Cherry Festival.

## Cherry type specimens

[Global Plants](https://plants.jstor.org/) is the world’s largest database of digitized plant specimens and a locus for international scientific research and collaboration.  The Global Plants database is a growing collection of nearly three million high-resolution type specimens and related materials from community contributors around the world.  Plant type specimens are in great demand for scientific study because of their pivotal role as original vouchers of nomenclature. They also act as a historical record of changes in various flora. The largest of its kind, Global Plants consists of 66 sub-collections, showcasing hand-selected specimens that have been meticulously digitized by partner herbaria with generous support from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. This resource also features partner-contributed reference works and primary sources, such as collectors’ correspondence and diaries, illustrations, and photographs.
